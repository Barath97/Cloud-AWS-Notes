what is data?
    Data refers to raw facts, figures, observations, or information that can be collected, 
    stored, and processed. It can take various forms, including numbers, text, images, 
    audio, video, and more. Data can be structured, such as in databases where it's 
    organized into tables with defined relationships, or unstructured, such as in text 
    documents or multimedia files.

There are two types of software :
    * Application software 
    * System software

Application software:
    Collection of programs is called Application software.

System software:
    System software = Operating System

Operating System:
    Interface between user and machine(computer hardware).
    Resources manager of a computer.
    It will manage the processes, memory and files.
    An operating system (OS) is a system software that connects a computer user with the
     computer's hardware. It is the main system software that allows a device to run.
    The software that contains the core components of the operating system is called the
    Kernal.

Kernal:
    The kernel is a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface
    between the computer's hardware and OS. The kernel enables multiple applications to 
    share hardware resources by providing access to CPU, memory, disk I/O, and networking.

Different types of OS:
    *Linux
    *Microsoft Windows
    *Apple Mac OS

types of OS:
    Client OS 
    Server OS 

Client OS:
    A client operating system (OS) is a simple operating system that runs on various client
    devices, such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. It is different from
    centralized servers because it only supports one user. Client OS manages local resources, 
    including files, printers, and peripheral devices. It is used to access services 
    provided by servers, such as Windows, Android, Firefox, Symbian, and macOS.

Server OS:
    Imagine you have a small business and you want to set up a server to store all your files,
    manage emails, host a website, and run some custom business applications. You'd need a server
    operating system to handle all these tasks efficiently.
    One popular example of a server operating system is Microsoft Windows Server. 
    It's designed specifically for servers and comes with features tailored for managing 
    networks, storing data, hosting websites, running applications, and more. With Windows Server,
    you can set up user accounts, manage permissions, configure security settings, and ensure that 
    your business operations run smoothly.
    So, in this scenario, Windows Server would be the server operating system you'd install on your 
    server computer to manage all your business needs effectively.

Types of services:
    client = Service receiver
    server = service provider

How server is controlling client computer?
    * Server computers and client computers are connected in "Network".
    * we need to configure server computer configuration in client computer.
    * client request will handle by the server and it will respond to the client.
    
How data transfer between two computers?
    Application > Data > NIC(Network Interface card) > Packet > transfer in cable(RJ45) > Packet > NIC > Data > Application

IP Address:
    An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique number that identifies a 
    device connected to the internet or a local network. IP addresses contain location 
    information and allow devices to communicate with each other. The internet needs IP 
    addresses to differentiate between different devices, such as computers, routers, and websites.

Subnetting:
    In networking it means taking a large group of IP addresses and splitting them into
    smaller groups called subnets.This helps manage and organize devices on a Network
    more efficiently, allowing different parts of the networks to be treated separately
    while still being connected.

Benefits of Subnetting:
    *security
    *Performance
    *Simplified Network management
    *Easy to solve network issue

Public Network:
    A public network can be accessed by anyone at any time, like the internet.

Private Network:
    Private networks, on the other hand, restrict access to the general public 
    and are typically used to connect private entities such as corporations or schools.

Virtual networks:
    A virtual network is a network that uses software and wireless technology to connect 
    devices, servers, virtual machines, and data centers.

Virtual  private network:
    A Virtual private network or vpn is like a secret tunnel on the internet.
    when you use it your online activites become private and secure.

waterfall methods:
    Before Devops organization were using this particular model software development methodology.
    Waterfall methodology is a widely used project management method with a linear approach from beginning
    to end of a project.
    It contains five phases:
            Requirement and Gathering Analysis -> Design -> Development -> test -> Deploy -> Maintenance

Agile methodology:
    In Agile methodology each project is broken up into serveral "Iteration".
    All the iteration should be of the same time duration(between 2 to 8 weeks).
    At the end of each iteration, a working product should be delivered.

    Analyze -> plan -> ( Design -> Build -> Test) -> Deploy
                                (iteration)


What is Devops?
    Devops combines development(dev) and operation(ops) to increase the efficiency,speed, and security of
    software development and delivery compared to traditional process.

Devops phases :
    The Devops culture is implemented in several phases with help of several tools

                            *Plan
                            *code (Tools - git)
                            *Build (Tools - Maven and gradel)
                            *Test (Tools - selenium)
                            *Deploy (Puppet)
                            *Operation (Ansible, Docker , Kubernates)
                            *Monitor (Nagios)
                            *Integrate (Jenkins)

Devops Stages:
        stage 1 --->  Version control(SCM --> Source code management)
        stage 2 --->  Continuous Integration
        stage 3 --->  Continuous delivery
        stage 4 --->  Continuous deployment

stage 1 --->  Version control(SCM --> Source code management)
        Maintains different version of the code.
            eg: so there are multiple developer write code for particular application, so how 
                will I know which developer made which commit and what time and which commit is cousing
                error, how will I revert back to the pervious commit and How will I manages the sourse
                code (Tool is git)

                SCM has to types
                    1 . Centralized version control System
                    2 . Distributed version control system (GIT)

stage 2 ---> CI - Continuous Integration (continuous Build)
        Continuous Integration means building application continuously.
        CI is a fundamental practice that involves merging code changes into a central repository.
            eg: Any developers Made a changes in source code a continuous integration server
                should pull that code and prepare to build means all(compile, validate, code review,
                Unit Testing, Integration testing etc)
    
stage 3 --->  CD - Continuous delivery (Continuous Test)
        Deploying the build application to test server performing UAT(user Acceptance testing)

stage 4 ---> CD - Continuous Deployment 
        Deploying the tested application on the production server for release.

stage 5 --->
        All the 4 stage will be Monitored(Continuous Monitoring) Tools link (Nagios)
    
    CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment, and is a 
    set of DevOps practices that aims to speed up the software development lifecycle. CI 
    is a fundamental practice that involves merging code changes into a central repository, 
    and CD can mean either continuous delivery or continuous deployment. CI/CD pipelines 
    automate the process of delivering code changes from developers' desktops to production.

Importance of security:
    Security is important at all the levels of SDLC.
    Challenges of implementing Security:
        There are two biggest Challenges that companies have,
            1 . Focus on fast development of new features
            2 . Application Systems become more complex
                        eg: we have a large containerized microservices applications that running in Kubernates
                            Clusters on cloud platform using tons of different aws services with data
                            persistence in ten different types of databases , you may have like a primary 
                            database, SQL database NoSQL Database, a caching or memory databaseand so on,
                            and tens of external services that your applications taking to(APIs).
                            Addtionaly we have a Streamlined CI/CD pipelines that deploys to Clusters.
